# CodeMate

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

Docker-based Claude Code environment with automated Git/PR setup.

> **⚠️ Security Notice:** This container runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by default, allowing Claude to execute commands without confirmation. Use only in isolated environments with trusted repositories.

## Why CodeMate?

Tired of approving every single command when pair programming with AI? Yet hesitant to grant full bypass permissions on your local machine? Every GitHub interaction requiring manual confirmation breaks your flow.

CodeMate solves this by running Claude Code in an isolated Docker container where it can operate freely without compromising your system. True pair programming starts here—let Claude focus on coding while you focus on the bigger picture.

## Features

- Automated repository cloning and PR management
- Pre-installed: Go, Node.js, Python, Rust, uv
- zsh with Oh My Zsh
- Persistent Claude configuration
- Built-in Claude Code skills for PR workflow automation
- Slack notifications when Claude stops (via `SLACK_WEBHOOK`)
- tmux session management with PR comment monitoring

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated
- Anthropic API key

Run `codemate --setup` to create the required configuration files (global config in `~/.codemate/` and project `.env`).

#### Mac Users

On macOS, you need a Docker runtime since Docker doesn't run natively. Choose one:

- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** - Official Docker GUI application
- **[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)** - Lightweight Docker runtime (recommended for CLI users)

### Installation

#### Global Installation (Recommended)

Install `codemate` globally to use it from anywhere:

```bash
# Install directly to /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoringHappy/CodeMate/main/codemate -o /usr/local/bin/codemate && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/codemate

# Or install to ~/.local/bin without sudo (ensure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoringHappy/CodeMate/main/codemate -o ~/.local/bin/codemate && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/codemate

# One-time global setup
codemate --setup

# Update to latest version
codemate --update
```

### Usage

#### Basic Commands

```bash
# First time setup - creates global config and project .env
codemate --setup

# Run with explicit repo URL
codemate --repo https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git --branch feature/xyz

# Run with branch name (auto-detects repo from: --repo > .env > current directory's git remote)
codemate --branch feature/your-branch

# Run with existing PR
codemate --pr 123

# Run with GitHub issue (creates branch issue-NUMBER)
codemate --issue 456

# Fork-based workflow (for open-source contributions)
codemate --repo https://github.com/yourname/project.git --upstream https://github.com/maintainer/project.git --branch fix-bug
codemate --repo https://github.com/yourname/project.git --upstream https://github.com/maintainer/project.git --issue 789

# Run with custom volume mounts (optional)
codemate --branch feature/xyz --mount ~/data:/data

# Run with initial query to Claude
codemate --branch feature/xyz --query "Please review the code and fix any issues"

# Build and run from local Dockerfile
codemate --build --branch feature/xyz

# Build with custom Dockerfile path and tag
codemate --build -f ./custom/Dockerfile --tag my-codemate:v1 --branch feature/xyz

# For Chinese users: Use DaoCloud mirror for faster image pulls
codemate --branch feature/xyz --image ghcr.m.daocloud.io/boringhappy/codemate:latest
```

The setup command will:
1. Create global configuration in `~/.codemate/` (Claude config and settings)
2. Create project-specific `.env` file in your current directory
3. Prompt you for Anthropic API token and other settings

**Configuration Structure:**
- **Global config**: `~/.codemate/` - Claude configuration and settings (shared across all projects)
- **Project config**: `.env` in each project directory - Project-specific secrets and settings

**Repository URL Resolution**: The script determines the repository URL in this priority order:
1. `--repo` command-line argument (highest priority)
2. `GIT_REPO_URL` environment variable or `.env` file
3. Current directory's git remote origin URL (auto-detected)
4. If none are available, an error is raised

##### Custom Volume Mounts

Use `--mount <host-path>:<container-path>` to mount additional directories or files. Useful for sharing data, configurations, or credentials with the container. Multiple `--mount` options can be specified.

##### Building from Local Dockerfile

For development or customization, you can build CodeMate from a local Dockerfile:

```bash
# Build from default Dockerfile in current directory
codemate --build --branch feature/xyz

# Build from custom Dockerfile path
codemate --build -f ./path/to/Dockerfile --branch feature/xyz

# Build with custom image tag
codemate --build --tag my-codemate:dev --branch feature/xyz

# Combine all options
codemate --build -f ./custom/Dockerfile --tag my-codemate:v1 --branch feature/xyz
```

**Options:**
- `--build` - Build Docker image from local Dockerfile before running
- `-f, --dockerfile PATH` - Path to Dockerfile (default: `docker/Dockerfile`)
- `--tag TAG` - Image tag for local build (default: `codemate:local`)
  - **Note:** Only works with `--build`. To use a pre-built image, use `--image` instead

When `--build` is used:
1. The script builds the Docker image from the specified Dockerfile
2. The default image tag is `codemate:local` (unless `--tag` is specified)
3. The locally built image is used instead of pulling from the registry
4. The `--image` option is ignored when `--build` is used

**Adding Custom Toolchains:**

To add additional toolchains or tools to the container, create a custom Dockerfile that extends the base image:

```dockerfile
# Custom Dockerfile with additional toolchains
FROM ghcr.io/boringhappy/codemate:latest

# Add Java
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven

# Add PHP
RUN apt-get install -y php php-cli php-mbstring composer

# Add Ruby
RUN apt-get install -y ruby-full
RUN gem install bundler

# Add any other tools you need
RUN apt-get install -y postgresql-client redis-tools

# Clean up
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Then build and run with your custom Dockerfile:

```bash
codemate --build -f ./Dockerfile.custom --tag codemate:custom --branch feature/xyz
```

## Environment Variables

## How It Works

CodeMate uses a separate [base image (`codemate-base`)](https://github.com/BoringHappy/CodeMate/pkgs/container/codemate-base) that is rebuilt weekly to keep system packages and development tools up-to-date.

On startup, the container:
1. Clones/updates repository to `/home/agent/<repo-name>`
2. Checks out specified branch or PR
3. Creates PR if working on new branch
4. Starts Claude Code in a tmux session with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
5. Sends initial query to Claude if `--query` is provided
6. Runs a cron job to monitor PR comments (every minute)

## Skills

[CodeMate](https://github.com/BoringHappy/CodeMate) comes with pre-installed skills from the [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser). These skills are automatically available when you start the container and provide workflow automation for Git, PR management, and browser interactions.

### Available Plugins

**Git Plugin** (`git@codemate`):
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/git:commit` | Stage all changes, create a commit with a meaningful message, and push to remote |

**PR Plugin** (`pr@codemate`):
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pr:get-details` | Fetch PR information including title, description, file changes, and review comments |
| `/pr:fix-comments` | Read PR review comments, fix the issues, commit changes, and reply to comments |
| `/pr:update` | Update PR title and/or summary. Use `--summary-only` to update only the summary |
| `/pr:ack-comments` | Acknowledge PR issue comments by adding 👀 reaction |
| `/pr:read-issue` | ~~Moved to `/issue:read-issue`~~ Read GitHub issue details including title, description, labels, and comments |

**Issue Plugin** (`issue@codemate`):

|---------|-------------|
| `/issue:read-issue` | Read GitHub issue details including title, description, labels, and comments |
| `/issue:refine-issue` | Rewrite issue body to match template (plan-then-execute, requires approval) |
| `/issue:triage-issue` | Apply priority and category labels based on content analysis |
| `/issue:classify-issue` | Post clarifying questions for ambiguous issues and add `needs-more-info` label |

**Browser Plugin** (`agent-browser`):
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agent-browser` | Automate browser interactions for web testing, form filling, screenshots, and data extraction |

### Custom Plugins

You can extend CodeMate with your own custom plugins by adding them to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Override default marketplaces (optional)
DEFAULT_MARKETPLACES=vercel-labs/agent-browser,BoringHappy/CodeMate

# Override default plugins (optional)
DEFAULT_PLUGINS=agent-browser@agent-browser,git@codemate,pr@codemate,dev@codemate

# Set to empty to disable all defaults (optional)
DEFAULT_MARKETPLACES=
DEFAULT_PLUGINS=

# Add custom plugin marketplaces (comma-separated GitHub repo paths)
CUSTOM_MARKETPLACES=username/my-marketplace,org/another-marketplace

# Add custom plugins to install (comma-separated plugin names)
CUSTOM_PLUGINS=my-plugin@my-marketplace,another-plugin@my-marketplace
```

**How it works:**
1. By default, CodeMate installs marketplaces from `DEFAULT_MARKETPLACES` and plugins from `DEFAULT_PLUGINS`
2. You can override these defaults by setting the environment variables to different values
3. You can disable all defaults by setting them to empty strings
4. Custom marketplaces and plugins are added after defaults during container startup
5. All plugins become available as skills (e.g., `/my-plugin:command`)
6. The setup is idempotent - already installed plugins are skipped

**Example:**

If you have a custom plugin marketplace at `github.com/myorg/my-plugins` with a plugin called `deploy`, you would configure:

```bash
CUSTOM_MARKETPLACES=myorg/my-plugins
CUSTOM_PLUGINS=deploy@my-plugins
```

Then use it in Claude Code:
```bash
/deploy:production
```

## Issue-Based Workflow

CodeMate supports starting work directly from a GitHub issue using the `--issue` flag. This workflow automatically:

1. Creates a branch named `issue-{NUMBER}` (or uses existing branch if it already exists)
2. Sends an initial query to Claude to read and address the issue using `/issue:read-issue` skill
3. Claude analyzes the issue details (title, description, labels, comments)
4. Claude implements the requested changes
5. Creates a PR when you're ready to commit

**Example:**

```bash
# Start working on issue #456
codemate --issue 456
```

This is equivalent to:
```bash
codemate --branch issue-456 --query "Please use /issue:read-issue skill to read and address issue #456"
```

**When to use:**
- Starting new work from a GitHub issue
- Implementing feature requests tracked as issues
- Fixing bugs documented in issues

## PR Comment Monitoring

CodeMate automatically monitors PR comments and notifies Claude when new feedback arrives. A cron job runs every minute to check for new comments.

### Comment Types

GitHub PRs have two types of comments that CodeMate monitors:

| Type | Location | API Endpoint | Use Case |
|------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Review Comments** | Files changed tab (inline) | `/pulls/{pr}/comments` | Code-specific feedback on particular lines |
| **Issue Comments** | Conversation tab | `/issues/{pr}/comments` | General discussion, questions, requests |

### Review Comments Workflow

When someone leaves a **review comment** (inline code comment):

1. Monitor detects unresolved review comments
2. Sends message to Claude: `"Please Use /fix-comments skill to address comments"`
3. Claude uses `/pr:fix-comments` skill to:
   - Read the feedback
   - Make code changes
   - Commit and push
   - Reply with "Claude Replied: ..." to mark as resolved

### Issue Comments Workflow

When someone leaves an **issue comment** (general PR comment):

1. Monitor detects new issue comments without 👀 reaction
2. Sends the actual comment content to Claude
3. Claude processes the request
4. Claude uses `/pr:ack-comments` skill to add 👀 reaction
5. Future runs skip comments with 👀 reaction

### Filtering Logic

Comments are filtered out if they:
- Start with "Claude Replied:" (already handled)
- Have 👀 reaction (already acknowledged)
- Were created by Claude itself

## Best Practices

### Add a Pull Request Template

Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` in your target repository to standardize PR descriptions:

```markdown
## Summary
<!-- Brief description of changes -->

## Test Plan
<!-- How to verify the changes -->

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

### Security Recommendations

- Run CodeMate only on trusted repositories
- Use short-lived GitHub tokens with minimal scopes
- Avoid mounting sensitive host directories
- Review changes before merging PRs created by Claude
