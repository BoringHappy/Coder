# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CodeMate is a Docker-based environment for running Claude Code with automated Git/PR setup. It runs Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in an isolated container, enabling AI pair programming without constant approval prompts.

## Running CodeMate

```bash
# Run with branch name (auto-detects repo from: --repo > .env > current directory's git remote)
codemate --branch feature/your-branch

# Run with explicit repo URL
codemate --repo https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git --branch feature/xyz

# Run with existing PR
codemate --pr 123

# Run with custom volume mounts
codemate --branch feature/xyz --mount /local/path:/container/path
```

Parameters:
- `--repo` - Repository URL (optional, auto-detects from .env or git remote)
- `--branch` - Branch to work on
- `--pr` - Existing PR number (alternative to --branch)
- `--mount` - Additional volume mounts (can be specified multiple times)

## Architecture

### Container Startup Flow

1. `setup/setup.sh` orchestrates initialization
2. `setup/shell/setup-git.sh` configures git user from environment variables
3. `setup/shell/setup-gh.sh` authenticates GitHub CLI with token
4. `setup/python/setup-repo.py` clones repo, checks out branch/PR, creates PR if needed
5. Claude Code starts with system prompt from `setup/prompt/system_prompt.txt`

Note: All setup scripts live under `docker/setup/` in the repository, but are copied to `/usr/local/bin/setup/` inside the container.

### Plugin Marketplace

CodeMate uses the CodeMatePlugin marketplace to distribute plugins. Plugins are installed at runtime during container startup via `setup/shell/setup-plugins.sh` using the `claude plugin` CLI commands.

The marketplace is fetched from the external repository: `BoringHappy/CodeMatePlugin`

**Default Marketplaces:**
- `vercel-labs/agent-browser` - Browser automation tools
- `codemate` (BoringHappy/CodeMate) - CodeMate plugins

**Default Plugins:**

**Agent Browser** (`agent-browser@agent-browser`):
- `/agent-browser:agent-browser` - Browser automation CLI for AI agents

**Git Plugin** (`git@codemate`):
- `/git:commit` - Stage, commit, and push changes

**PR Plugin** (`pr@codemate`):
- `/pr:get-details` - Fetch PR information including comments
- `/pr:fix-comments` - Address PR review feedback
- `/pr:update` - Update PR title and summary

**Dev Plugin** (`dev@codemate`):
- `/dev:read-env-key` - List environment variable keys

**Issue Plugin** (`issue@codemate`):
- `/issue:read-issue` - Fetch issue details including comments
- `/issue:refine-issue` - Rewrite issue body to match template (plan-then-execute, requires approval)
- `/issue:judge-issue` - Apply priority and category labels based on content analysis
- `/issue:classify-issue` - Post clarifying questions for ambiguous issues and add `needs-more-info` label

**Configuring Default Plugins:**

You can customize which marketplaces and plugins are installed by default using environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Override default marketplaces (comma-separated GitHub repo paths)
DEFAULT_MARKETPLACES=vercel-labs/agent-browser,BoringHappy/CodeMate

# Override default plugins (comma-separated plugin@marketplace)
DEFAULT_PLUGINS=agent-browser@agent-browser,git@codemate,pr@codemate,dev@codemate,issue@codemate

# Set to empty to disable all defaults
DEFAULT_MARKETPLACES=
DEFAULT_PLUGINS=
```

**Custom Plugins:**

You can add additional custom plugin marketplaces and plugins by configuring environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Add custom marketplaces (comma-separated GitHub repo paths)
CUSTOM_MARKETPLACES=username/my-marketplace,org/another-marketplace

# Add custom plugins to install (comma-separated plugin names)
CUSTOM_PLUGINS=my-plugin@my-marketplace,another-plugin@my-marketplace
```

Custom marketplaces and plugins are added/installed after the default ones during container startup. The setup script will automatically:
1. Add all default and custom marketplaces to Claude Code
2. Install all default and custom plugins from those marketplaces
3. Skip any that are already installed (idempotent)

### Key Files

- `docker/Dockerfile` - Main container definition, uses `codemate-base` image
- `docker/Dockerfile.base` - Base image with system packages and development tools
- `docker/Dockerfile.pure-claude` - Minimal Claude Code image
- `docker/setup/` - Container setup scripts (copied into container at build time)
- `codemate` - Main script to run CodeMate with configuration management (installed globally or run locally)
- `docker/setup/python/setup-repo.py` - Main repo/PR setup logic, reads PR template from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

## Development Notes

- No test suite exists - this is infrastructure/tooling
- GitHub Actions workflow (`docker-build-push.yml`) builds and pushes to GHCR on main branch and tags
- Multi-platform builds: linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
